			<!-- ================================== INTRO == -->

			<p class="intro">Design is about more than creating a good-looking final product. The process of taking an idea from inception to completion is where a design becomes something more: a solution. <br><br>

			Throughout my process I make very conscious and intentional design decisions that resolve usability challenges and improve the overall experience. Iterating within each step of my process allows me to produce a strong, well-developed design solution.</p>

					<h3>Research + Sketches:</h3>

					<p>I begin each project by reviewing the client brief to gain an in-depth understanding of their needs.<br><br>

					I then start to consider the site’s information architecture and explore the most efficient way to organize the flow from page to page.<br><br>

					Lastly, I begin to explore page layouts by creating quick thumbnails and sketches.</p>

					<h3>Wireframes:</h3>

					<p>Wireframing is where I work out the site’s hierarchical structure in a very clean and organized fashion. <br><br>

					These diagrams become a useful tool when communicating ideas to client prior to designing the look and feel of the site.</p>

						<h3>Design + Build:</h3>

						<p>Once all previous stages are solidified, I begin to visually bring the site to life. I enjoy revisiting my notes outlining the client’s brand and goals to fully implement both.<br><br>

						In this phase I test the design in various browsers and on different devices for usability flaws. <br><br>

						In the example, the initial design did not display any navigational options upon opening. Changes were made to correct this and to improve the site’s functionality.</p>
